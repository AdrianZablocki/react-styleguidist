## We need you!

Help us develop and maintain Styleguidist:

- Answer questions in [GitHub issues](https://github.com/styleguidist/react-styleguidist/issues) and [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/react-styleguidist).
- Review [pull requests](https://github.com/styleguidist/react-styleguidist/pulls).
- Fix bugs and add new features.
- Write articles and talk about Styleguidist on conferences and meetups (weâ€™re always happy to review your texts and slides).

## Commit message conventions

[Commit message conventions](https://github.com/tamiadev/semantic-release-tamia/blob/master/Convention.md) are based on Angular conventions.

## Pull requests

Maintainers merge pull requests by squashing all commits and editing the commit message if necessary.

Use an [appropriate commit type](https://github.com/tamiadev/semantic-release-tamia/blob/master/Convention.md#types). Be especially careful with [breaking changes](https://github.com/tamiadev/semantic-release-tamia/blob/master/Convention.md#breaking-changes).

## Releases

We used to deliver [semi-automated releases](http://blog.sapegin.me/all/semantic-release) with semantic-release. To adapt the delivery to management of a monorepo, we now use [lerna version](https://github.com/lerna/lerna/tree/master/commands/version).

### Patch releases

Patch releases are fully automated â€” any commit of a `Fix` type is published as a patch release as soon as CI passes.

### Minor and major releases

Weâ€™re using [milestones](https://github.com/styleguidist/react-styleguidist/milestones) to group approved pull requests that should be released together. Minor and major releases require a change log (see below). Any commit of a `feat`Â type will not trigger a release until you commit a change log. `lerna version` will publish a major release, if there are any commits with [breaking changes](https://github.com/conventional-changelog-archived-repos/conventional-changelog-angular/blob/master/convention.md#footer).

1.  Merge all pull request from a milestone
2.  Resolve possible merge conflicts.
3.  Manually check that Styleguidist still works.
4.  Prepare and commit a change log.
5.  Wait until lerna publishes the release.
6.  Tweet the release!

## Change logs

### What is a good change log

- Change logs are written for users, not developers.
- Change log should show new features with code examples or GIFs.
- Change log should make all breaking changes clear.
- Change log should explain how to migrate to a new versions if there are breaking changes.
- Commit log **is not** a change log.

Hereâ€™s a [good example of a change log](https://github.com/styleguidist/react-styleguidist/releases/tag/v7.1.0). Check out [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/) for more details on good change logs.
